# 🏠 House Price Prediction - A Learning Project

This repository hosts a basic machine learning project focused on predicting house prices.  
The goal of this project is to provide a foundational understanding of the **supervised machine learning workflow**, with a particular focus on **regression analysis**.  

It’s a great starting point for beginners to grasp key concepts from **data exploration** to **model evaluation**.

## 📌 Project Overview
The main objective is to build a machine learning model that can **predict the sale price of a house** based on a dataset of various features.  

This project showcases a **practical application of machine learning** by taking a real-world problem and solving it with code.

## ✨ Key Features and Learning Goals
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handle and clean raw datasets, deal with missing values, and prepare data for modeling.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Use data visualization to identify patterns and relationships between features and house price.  
- **Simple Regression Model**: Train a basic regression model using scikit-learn (e.g., Linear Regression).  
- **Model Evaluation**: Measure performance with **MAE**, **MSE**, and **R²**.  
- **Code Documentation**: Write clean, commented code with a well-structured Jupyter Notebook.
